## Change Package Name

**Change Package Name** is a fix patch that changes the app package name from  
`com.gamestar.perfectpiano` to `com.kenzx.perfectpiano`.

This is required for the app to work correctly with my patches. Additionally, it allows the patched app to be installed **alongside the original app** as a separate installation, without conflicts.
